An arcade video game developed with Python and PyGame.

- Users control a character that is capable of fighting different enemies.
- User loses health every time he/she defeats an enemy.
- This promotes having to use potions to regenerate health.
- The goal here is to have the highest score without dying.
- Would like to implement a timer/end game that displays a top 10 leaderboard.
