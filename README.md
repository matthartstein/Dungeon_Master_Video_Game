An arcade video game developed with Python and PyGame.

- Users control a character that is capable of fighting different enemies.
- User loses health every time he/she defeats an enemy.
- This promotes having to use potions to regenerate health.
- The goal here is to have the highest score without dying.
- Would like to implement an end game with a leaderboard of the top 10 highest scores.
